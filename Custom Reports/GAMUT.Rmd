# How it's done

# Start with  a parameterized Rmarkdown report

```r  
---
output: html_document
params: 
  carrier: "AA" 
title: "Departure Delay Report for 'r params$carrier'"
---

{r, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
source("load_data.R")

carrier_median_delay %>%
    glue_data("At {origin}, 
    the median departure delay for {params$carrier} was 
    {median_dep_delay} minutes.</BR>")
 
kable(carrier_table)
```

# Driver script

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(nycflights13::airlines,4)

```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
#' driver.R

data("airlines")

for(i in airlines$carrier) {
    rmarkdown::render("example.Rmd",
                      {{params = list(carrier = i),}}
                      output_dir = "reports",
                      output_file = paste0(i, "_report.html")
                      )
