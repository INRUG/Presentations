	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}: In a systematic review, we have evaluated double-blind, randomized, controlled trials of intra-articular local anesthesia compared with placebo or no treatment in the control of postoperative pain after arthroscopic knee surgery.
{METHODS}: Outcome measures were pain scores, supplementary analgesics, and time to first analgesic request. Efficacy was estimated by significant difference (P {\textless} .05) as reported in the original reports and by calculation of the weighted mean difference of pain scores between treatment groups.
{RESULTS}: Twenty studies with data from 895 patients were considered appropriate for analysis. Twelve of these 20 studies showed improved pain relief after intra-articular local anesthesia in at least one of the considered pain parameters, whereas the eight other studies were without such improvements. In ten of the positive studies, pain scores were significantly lower in the treatment groups compared with the control groups with visual analog scale ({VAS}) score reductions of between 10 and 35 mm early (1-4 hours) postoperatively. Quantitative analysis with calculation of the weighted mean difference in {VAS} confirmed a statistically significant but minor clinically important effect on postoperative pain scores. In nine studies, the consumption of supplementary analgesics was reduced 10-50\% during observation periods of up to 4 hours; however, in most cases, the analgesic requirements were small to moderate. Only in two of six studies, where time to first analgesic request was evaluated, a significant prolongation of pain relief was observed as lasting between 30 and 50 minutes.
{CONCLUSIONS}: There is a weak evidence for a reduction of postoperative pain after intra-articular local anesthesia in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery, which although being sinall to moderate and of short duration, may be of clinical significance in day-case surgery.},

	issn = {0277-0008},
	doi = {10.1592/phco.28.12.1453},
	abstract = {{STUDY} {OBJECTIVES}: To compare opioid requirements in opioid-tolerant and opioid-naïve patients after total knee arthroplasty, and to compare pain scores, sedation scores, and adverse effects between the groups.
{DESIGN}: Prospective, observational study.
{SETTING}: Academic medical center.
{PATIENTS}: Twenty-nine patients aged 18 years or older who underwent elective total knee arthroplasty between October 1, 2005, and June 31, 2007.
{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}: Patients were classified on the basis of their daily opioid consumption during the week before surgery: those who required 10 mg or less of oral morphine equivalent were considered opioid naïve (20 patients), and those who required at least 30 mg of oral morphine equivalent were opioid tolerant (nine patients). Postoperative opioid consumption, pain scores, sedation scores, and adverse effects were compared between the two groups up to 48 hours after discharge from the postanesthesia care unit ({PACU}). Postoperative opioid consumption (in intravenous morphine equivalents) was significantly greater in the opioid-tolerant group than in the opioid-naïve group in the {PACU} (median 56 vs 8.2 mg, p=0.0013), during the first 24 hours after discharge from the {PACU} (108 vs 20.5 mg, p=0.0004), and 24-48 hours after discharge from the {PACU} (152.3 vs 25 mg, p=0.0001). Pain scores, assessed by using a verbal numeric scale from 0-10, were significantly greater in the opioid-tolerant group than in the opioid-naïve group during the first 24 hours after discharge from the {PACU} (5.9 vs 4.1, p=0.03). We observed no significant difference in pain scores during the other time periods studied. Sedation scores and adverse effects were similar between groups.
{CONCLUSION}: After total knee arthroplasty, patients tolerant to opioids required significantly more opioids in the {PACU} and up to 48 hours after discharge from the {PACU} than did opioid-naïve patients. Opioid-tolerant patients also experienced greater pain during the first 24 hours after discharge from the {PACU}; however, sedation scores and adverse effects did not appear to be significantly different at any of the time periods studied. Clinicians need to be aggressive with pain management immediately after surgery and ensure that patients restart any opioid treatment at home as soon as possible.},

	abstract = {The use of local anesthetics to reduce acute postoperative pain has a long history, but recent reports have not been systematically reviewed. In addition, the need to include only those clinical studies that meet minimum standards for randomization and blinding must be adhered to. In this review, we have applied stringent clinical study design standards to identify publications on the use of perioperative local anesthetics. We first examined several types of peripheral nerve blocks, covering a variety of surgical procedures, and second, we examined the effects of intentionally administered {IV} local anesthetic (lidocaine) for suppression of postoperative pain. Thirdly, we have examined publications in which vascular concentrations of local anesthetics were measured at different times after peripheral nerve block procedures, noting the incidence when those levels reached ones achieved during intentional {IV} administration. Importantly, the very large number of studies using neuraxial blockade techniques (epidural, spinal) has not been included in this review but will be dealt with separately in a later review. The overall results showed a strongly positive effect of local anesthetics, by either route, for suppressing postoperative pain scores and analgesic (opiate) consumption. In only a few situations were the effects equivocal. Enhanced effectiveness with the addition of adjuvants was not uniformly apparent. The differential benefits between drug delivery before, during, or immediately after a surgical procedure are not obvious, and a general conclusion is that the significant antihyperalgesic effects occur when the local anesthetic is present during the acute postoperative period, and its presence during surgery is not essential for this action.},
