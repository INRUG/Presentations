### Question
Is the percentage of smokers significantly different between groups of patients?

### Data






|   | Smokers | Total_Patients | Percent_Smokers |
|:--|:-------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|
|1  |   80    |       86       |       93%       |
|2  |   84    |       93       |      90.3%      |
|3  |   129   |      136       |      94.9%      |
|4  |   90    |      120       |       75%       |

### Results
This example includes the smoking status from 4 groups of patients. ${\chi}^2$ analysis of the proportion of smokers vs non-smokers indicate they are  significantly different between groups (93% vs. 90.3% vs. 94.9% vs. 75%, $p$-value < 0.001, 99% confidence level).
